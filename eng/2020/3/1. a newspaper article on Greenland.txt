<speak>As the ice melts, Greenland considers its future<break time="1000ms"/>
Nine times bigger than the UK, Greenland is the world's largest island if Australia is considered to be a continent. Located mostly within the Arctic Circle, some three quarters of the land is permanently covered in an ice sheet. With a population of about 56,000, it is the least densely populated country or territory on Earth. A third of the people live in the capital Nuuk, and there are almost no roads to the other towns on the coast. Instead, you have to fly or go by boat, both of which are often not possible during winter. 
Owned by Denmark since 1814, Greenland is an autonomous territory with its own parliament which takes care of domestic matters. The Danish parliament in Copenhagen, to which Greenland sends two MPs to represent it, looks after its international affairs. Currently Greenland's economy is reliant upon two things: fishing, which accounts for 95% of its exports, and an annual grant from the Danish government. This subsidy totals $600m, and provides more than half of the yearly budget of the Greenland government. 
Commentators say that there are two reasons why Greenland is now enthusiastically watched by the US and China – economic and strategic. And both are linked to climate change. Economically, Greenland has some of the largest deposits of the so called rare earth metals which are increasingly used in the manufacturing of mobile phones, computers and electric cars. And strategically, the country lies between North America, Europe and Russia. Climate change and specifically warmer temperatures mean that it might become easier to both mine those metals and navigate through the surrounding Arctic Ocean, either in a cargo ship or a military vessel.
Greenland is not used to being the centre of attention, but last year it made the front pages of newspapers around the world. It came after US President Donald Trump said that he wanted the US to buy the vast Arctic island from Denmark. The Danish government immediately replied that Greenland was not for sale, and it led to a diplomatic argument. Soon the US announced a different policy to increase its presence and influence in Greenland – it is going to open a consulate there later this year. While the Danish government declined to comment, opposition Danish MP Soren Espersen says he is concerned that the US consulate in Greenland will increase calls in Greenland for independence. Currently surveys on the issue are inconclusive, with some suggesting that as many as 64% of Greenlanders want the country to separate from Denmark, while others have put it as low as 38%.
