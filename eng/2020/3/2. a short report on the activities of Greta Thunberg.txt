<speak>Greta Thunberg – what does the teenage climate change activist want?<break time="1000ms"/>
Greta Thunberg is the Swedish teenager who missed school lessons and inspired an international movement to fight climate change. She has become a leading voice, inspiring millions to join protests around the world. But who is she and what does she want?
She is a 17-year-old who grew up in Stockholm, in Sweden. Her mother is an opera singer and her father – an actor. One of Greta's great grandfathers was a scientist who made a model of the greenhouse effect and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903.
In May 2018, aged 15, Greta won a climate change essay competition in a local newspaper. Three months later, in August, she started protesting in front of the building of the Swedish parliament, declaring she would continue to do so until the Swedish government met the carbon emissions target agreed by world leaders in Paris, in 2015. She held a sign that read "School Strike for Climate" and began regularly missing lessons to go on strike on Fridays, urging students around the world to join her. Her protests spread rapidly on social media and as support for her cause grew, other strikes started around the world.
By December 2018, more than 20,000 students around the world had joined her in countries including Australia, the UK, Belgium, the US and Japan. She joined strikes around Europe, choosing to travel by train to limit her impact on the environment. The teenager took the whole of 2019 off school to continue campaigning, to attend key climate conferences, and to join student protests around the world.
In September 2019, she travelled to New York to address a UN climate conference. Greta refuses to fly because of its impact on the environment, so she made her way there on a racing yacht, in a journey that lasted two weeks. When she arrived, millions of people around the world took part in a climate strike, underlining the scale of her influence. Addressing the conference, she sharply criticized politicians for relying on young people for answers to climate change.
Greta says big governments and businesses around the world are not moving quickly enough to cut carbon emissions and has attacked world leaders for failing young people. Initially, her protests focused on the Swedish government's climate targets, and she urged students around the world to make similar demands in their own countries. But as her fame has grown, she has called for governments around the world to do more to cut global emissions. She has spoken at international meetings, including the UN's 2019 climate change gathering in New York, and this year's World Economic Forum in Davos.
At the forum, she called for banks, firms and governments to stop investing and subsidising fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and gas. "Instead, they should invest their money in existing sustainable technologies, research and in restoring nature," she said.
