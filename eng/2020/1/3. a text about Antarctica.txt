Antarctica - The Ice Continent<break time="1000ms"/>
Antarctica contains 90% of the world's ice. Most of this ice is part of the ice sheet that covers the land mass, which is approximately 14 million square kilometres – the combined area of France, Spain, and Germany is only a tenth of this. Every winter parts of the Southern Ocean freeze over and effectively double the ice-covered area. This freeze is the largest seasonal natural phenomenon on the planet. The cold water current circling the continent cuts it off from warmer climatic zones. Antarctica is in all aspects isolated from the outside world and travellers will understand what this means when they experience “the windiest, the coldest, the driest, and the highest continent”. Someone once said: “The person who is able to express the feeling of being inAntarctica in words has probably not been there.” Antarctica has no permanent human inhabitants, but it is home to millions of penguins, and is the feeding area for thousands of whales in the Austral summer. It is also a continent dedicated to science and peace.
The continent is protected by the Antarctic Treaty of 1959. However, pre-treaty, eight nations made claims to portions of Antarctica – Norway had the second largest claim, second only to Australia.
The one-and-a-half-day crossing of the Drakes Passage, the 800 km-wide gap between the tip of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula, is just what is needed to prepare travellers for Antarctica. You have time to think and learn about what lies ahead. The giant tabular icebergs broken off the edge of the Antarctic mainland, the shoals of penguins swimming out to sea to hunt for krill, the torpedo-like leopard seal patrolling the shorelines, keeping a sharp eye on all movements, the breath of the humpback whale that is heard in the distance followed by frantic turnings of heads trying to locate it.
