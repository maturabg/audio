Tipping Troubles<break time="1000ms"/>
How much money do you leave the waiter in a restaurant? What about taxi drivers, hotel staff and hairdressers? Tipping is complex, but even more so when you're abroad.
The problem is that every country seems to have its own unofficial “rules”. In Australia, for example, tipping isn't very common, and tips aren't really expected in restaurants or anywhere else as a matter of fact. It's the same in Iceland and China. And in Japan, it can actually be considered rude to tip in a restaurant. In fact, if you leave money, a waiter might even run after you to give it back. In most of Europe, however, tipping a waiter is common. In England and Germany, for example, most people tip around 10% of the bill. But in Spain people generally only leave small change.
However, if there's one country where you really should tip, it's the United States. In contrast to Japan, a waiter will probably chase you down the street if you don't leave a tip! Not only that, but Americans usually tip up to 20% in restaurants. So, if you're saving up for a big dinner in the US, make sure you take that into account. Americans also tip for drinks. In fact, there are some bars in New York where staff earn such big money from tips that they receive no wages. Some people even pay to work there!
But it isn't only in bars and restaurants where you're supposed to tip. Here's some advice from a travel website on how you should tip in an American hotel: $3 for the parking attendant, $2 for the doorperson if they hail a taxi for you, and $1 for each bag they help you with. The bellhop boy gets $2 per bag he carries for you upstairs, and you should leave the maids $3 to $5 a day. So, for two people for one weekend that's about $20 before you've even paid for the room.
But why is there so much tipping in the United States? Well, in most cases, workers are paid below the minimum wage as they're expected to make up the difference with tips. Service sector workers are even expected to pay income tax on the tips as they're considered part of their normal wages for the job they do – not just “extra” money.
