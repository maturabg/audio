<speak>Father's day<break time="1000ms"/>
Father's Day is a celebration honouring fathers and celebrating fatherhood, paternal bonds, and the influence of fathers in society. In Catholic Europe, it has been celebrated on March 19 (St. Joseph's Day) since the early Middle Ages. This celebration was brought by the Spanish and Portuguese to Latin America, where March 19 is still used for it, though many countries in Europe and the Americas have adopted the U.S. date, which is the third Sunday of June.  
Father's Day was not celebrated in the United States, outside Catholic traditions, until the 20th century. As a civic celebration, it was introduced in the early 20th century to complement Mother's Day by celebrating fathers and male parenting. 
Historically, Sonora Smart Dodd was the woman behind the celebration of male parenting in the USA. Her father, the Civil War veteran William Jackson Smart, had to raise his six children alone after his wife died. After hearing a sermon about Mother's Day in 1909, she told her pastor that fathers should have a similar holiday honouring them. Although she initially suggested June 5, her father's birthday, the pastors did not have enough time to prepare their sermons, and the celebration was deferred to the third Sunday of June. The first celebration was in Spokane, Washington at the Young Men's Christian Association on June 19, 1910.   
In recognition of what fathers do for their families, on this day people may have a party celebrating male parenting or simply make a phone call or send a greeting card. Besides, schools help children prepare handmade gifts for their fathers many days before the celebration.
