At last, a nightclub where you can hear your feet shuffling on the dancefloor... 
The Glastonbury festival might seem the most unlikely place for those looking for a spot of peace and quiet, but festival visitors who stumbled into the dance tent witnessed a strange event: clubbers dancing in complete silence, broken only by the squelching of several hundred pairs of shoes. 
It was the latest manifestation of a concept that looks set to revolutionise club culture: the silent disco. The idea is quite simple. Clubs give visitors wireless headphones on entry, complete with volume, bass and treble controls. Clubbers can then turn the volume up to 11 and dance all night without waking up the neighbours. 
Evidently the idea has widespread appeal, so the time has come to take the concept a step further. Why not turn every club in residential areas into a silent disco? 
It makes perfect sense. Clubbers can listen to loud music for as long as they want. Anyone who wants to chat can simply take off their headphones and talk without having to shout over high decibels, in an atmosphere perfectly good for a conversation. 
There are other benefits as well. Why not introduce multiple channels of music that clubbers can choose between with a flick of a switch? Fed up with the White Stripes or Beyoncé mash-up the DJ's playing? Simply tune into the dancehall-raggatron channel instead. In fact, forget about music channels - club owners could just ask visitors to bring in their iPods and dispense with DJs altogether. Clubs cut the cost of sound systems and DJ fees, and clubbers get to listen to music they actually like. 
So, a big shout for the silent disco. <prosody rate="slow">On second thought, make</prosody> <prosody rate="x-slow">that</prosody> a hushed whisper.
