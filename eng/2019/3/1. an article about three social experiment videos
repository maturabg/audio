<speak>What would you do if you noticed some keys on the ground, a £5 note attached to a board in the street, or a lost girl in a shopping centre? Social experiment videos (shot with a hidden camera) aim to find out how people will react in a variety of situations. And the videos go viral as the results are so interesting. 
As part of this social experiment, five £5 notes were attached to a board in the street with a message that read: “This money is for people in need only.” Most passers-by stare at the “free money” and take pictures of it. In one case, two women are seen removing two of the £5 notes, but this is only so they can give them to a nearby homeless man. Then, in another show of goodwill, a man is filmed pinning an extra £5 note onto the sign. However, it doesn't end well as two men are seen pocketing the remaining £20. 
In another experiment, two little girls pretend to be lost in a busy shopping centre. Hidden cameras record Uma (aged 7) and Maya (aged 5) who take it in turns to look lost. Astonishingly, over a period of about an hour, only one person (a grandmother) stops to ask if they're all right. And over 600 people just walk past, ignoring them. Experts say the reluctance of the passers-by to do anything to help may have something to do with a fear – especially among men – that any help they offer could be “misinterpreted”.  
In an experiment by Swedish YouTube channel STHLM Panda, a man dressed in a suit is filmed asking bus drivers if he can ride for free because he's lost his wallet. Each time, he's allowed on the bus, and the bus drivers treat him “nicely”. Some even offer to help look for his “lost wallet.” Later, the exact same man asks the same question. However, this time, he's wearing a cheap jacket and carrying his belongings in a plastic bag. And when he asks for the free ride, all the drivers say no. 
So, what does this tell us about humankind?
