Once, an old man, a boy, and a donkey were travelling from one town to another. They decided that the boy would ride the donkey, and the old man would walk alongside. While moving down the road, they passed a group of people, who began speaking among themselves, saying what a shame it was for such a strong, young boy to be riding on the donkey, leaving this old, weak man to walk alongside. The boy overheard their words, and, feeling ashamed, suggested that the old man should ride the donkey, and that he would walk alongside. 
A while later, they passed another group of people, who began commenting on how shocking it was to see this man riding the donkey, while making such a small boy walk. The two overheard their comments, and decided that they should both just walk and put an end to all these opinions. 
Eventually, they passed some more villagers, who began to laugh at how silly it was for these two people to be walking when they had a perfectly good donkey to ride. The man and the boy decided that maybe the critics were right, and they decided to both ride the donkey. 
Soon, they ran into another group of people who were unpleasantly surprised to see such animal cruelty. What a load to put on this poor little creature! Hearing their words, the man and boy felt terrible. They wanted to give the poor donkey a break, and decided to carry the donkey for the rest of their way.   
While crossing a bridge, they lost their hold on the animal, and he fell into the river, to be seen no more. The moral of this story: If you try to please everyone, you will eventually lose yourself!
