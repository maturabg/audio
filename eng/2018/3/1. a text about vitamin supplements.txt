A recent research study has suggested certain vitamin supplements do not make our life longer and could even be harmful. The research involved selecting various studies on vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and some minerals which the research team felt were the most likely to fairly reflect the impact of the supplements on reducing death rate. 
It has been thought that these supplements may be able to prevent damage to the body's tissues called “oxidative stress” by eliminating the molecules called “free radicals” which are said to cause it. But a review of a large number of studies found “no convincing evidence” that antioxidant supplements contributed to a healthier life. On the contrary, the overconsumption of vitamins has been proven to damage our health. 
The Department of Health said people should try to get the vitamins they need from their diet, and avoid taking large doses of supplements – a market which is worth over £330 million in the UK. “There is a need to exercise caution in the use of high doses of purified supplements of vitamins, including antioxidant vitamins, and minerals,” a spokesperson said. “Their impact on long-term health may not have been fully established and they cannot be assumed to be without risk.” 
But the Health Supplements Information Service, which is funded by the association which represents those who sell supplements, say that many people are simply not able to get everything they need from their diet. “For the millions who are not able to do that, vitamins can be a useful supplement and they should not stop taking them,” said spokeswoman Pamela Mason. Another nutritionist, Patrick Holford said: “Antioxidants are not meant to be magic pills and should not be expected to undo a lifetime of unhealthy habits. But when used properly, in combination with eating a healthy diet full of fruit and vegetables, getting plenty of exercise and not smoking, antioxidant supplements can play an important role in maintaining and promoting overall health.”
