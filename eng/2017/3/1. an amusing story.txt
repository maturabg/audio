<speak>A SEASON FOR MERCY.<break time="1000ms"/>
Polly, my stepmom, suggested the sweetest name: Mercy. We soon learned it was just what this new puppy would need. 
She would jump out of bed and <prosody rate="slow">go-go-go</prosody> all day long. So when my Dad and Polly brought home a Christmas tree, they expected chaos. To their astonishment, Mercy didn't seem to care. She paid zero attention to the tree suddenly growing in her living room. She didn't react when they placed fancy presents under it, including a wrapped box of dog biscuits. 
Dad and Polly were suspicious; they'd never had a dog that didn't force them to move everything to higher ground, as if expecting a flood. 
A few days before Christmas, Polly woke early. She passed the dark living room. Then suddenly she stopped cold. Glancing back into the room, she saw that all the presents were gone. Only the tree was still there. 
Had they been robbed? Why hadn't Mercy barked? Mercy! Where was she? Had the burglars taken her? Just then, Polly noticed a piece of ribbon on the floor. Then a bit of torn wrapping paper a few feet away. The trail led toward the back door. 
Polly took a torch and stepped out into the backyard. A head lifted and froze, caught in the spotlight. Alarm and guilt made her eyes wide. Oh, yes, it was Mercy. 
Mercy lay under her favourite tree in a nest of torn paper, chewed-up boxes and bits of ribbon. Fragments of paper mixed with the last remaining evidence of gifts. 
Clearly Mercy's self-control had failed. She'd silently carried one package after another through the house and out the doggy door. 
Anything edible was gone, including cookies, fancy breads, chocolates, candy canes and a kilo of dog biscuits. Fortunately, Mercy survived her massive midnight snack. My parents were so grateful she was OK that she didn't even get a scolding from them, they just laughed about the ruined presents. Only one problem remained. With all the gift tags destroyed, how could they send out thank-you cards? 
Well, Mercy provided the problem, so Mercy provided the answer. A few days later, Polly returned to her easy chair to find Mercy guiltily licking a plate where a donut had just been. 
Polly took a picture of the shamefaced dog and used it to make thank-you cards. In them she explained the whole story. It was embarrassing, but Christmas is a season for mercy.
