Mrs. Selfridge – a self-important elderly lady, who was quite overweight, liked to travel in comfort, so whenever she got on a train, she always put her suitcase on the seat beside her, pretending it belonged to another passenger who had gone to buy something in the station. In this way she would have more space to herself during the journey. 
One day she did this when the train was very crowded. Other passengers came and sat down in all other seats except the one which her suitcase was lying on. Then a gentleman arrived, looked at Mrs. Selfridge's case and said: “Is this anybody's seat?” 
“Yes,” answered Mrs. Selfridge. “A friend of mine is travelling with me, and she has gone to buy some snacks from the kiosk on the platform. She'll return soon.”  
“All right,” said the gentleman and calmly removed the suitcase from the seat. “I'll sit here until your friend comes back, and then I'll stand somewhere.” Mrs. Selfridge did not feel happy about this, but there was nothing she could do or say because all the other passengers were watching. 
Several minutes passed and then the train began to move. It was pulling out of the station, slowly gathering speed, when the gentleman jumped up suddenly and shouted, “I'm sorry but it seems your friend has missed the train! We don't want her to be left without her suitcase, do we? I don't believe she would like that at all!” And before Mrs. Selfridge could do anything to stop him, he took the suitcase and threw it out of the open window.
