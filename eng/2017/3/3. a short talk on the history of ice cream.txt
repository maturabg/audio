While few people claim to be addicted to it, ice cream is certainly a great favourite among people of all ages in many parts of the world. Although it is commonly believed to have originated in China, and has long been associated with Italian manufacturers, it doesn't actually come from either of those countries. Ice cream originated when chemists in the Middle East worked out that adding salt to water reduces its freezing point, making it possible to cool it below its normal freezing point without turning it to ice. In the eleventh century wealthy Arabs were certainly enjoying water ice sweetened with sugar or fruit juice – a drink they called “sherbet”. 
Folklore also holds that Nero, the Roman Emperor, invented water ice during the first century AD when he sent slaves up in the mountains and made them pass buckets of snow, hand over hand, to his banquet hall, where it was mixed with honey and wine. However, there is nothing to prove that tale. 
Well, one way or another, the method for making this delicacy found its way into Europe. The first book to mention it was published in Italy in 1530. At that time, water ices were typically served by monarchs and other important people as a special treat on great occasions. The British are supposed to have been responsible for coming up with the idea of using cream in their ices instead of plain water, and thus ice cream as we know it today was born. 
However, for a long time ice cream remained an expensive luxury because it relied on ice imported in vast blocks from colder climates. It was only from the mid-nineteenth century onwards, with the invention of modern refrigeration techniques, that ice cream started to become the familiar item of mass consumption that it is today.
