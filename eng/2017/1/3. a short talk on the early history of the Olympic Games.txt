Although we do not know the exact origin of the earliest Olympic games, we do know that the ancient Greeks had a festival in which athletes competed in sports. This celebration was held regularly every four years and was open to all men and boys who spoke Greek as their native language. These ancient games were simpler than our modern ones. They were not for professional sportsmen but for the common people. For the month before the festival, the athletes attended a formal course at the gymnasium in the city of Olympia. The competition itself consisted of a single footrace. Later festivals included such sports as jumping, discus throwing, and horse racing. 
These early Olympic games were most popular around the fifth century B.C. At that time, winning at a sport brought the highest possible honour to the individual competitor, his family, and his city. The winner of the game received neither gold nor silver but a simple crown of olive leaves. Participation was reserved for amateur athletes, which meant that athletes were not paid to perform their sport. Later, however, the Greeks began paying athletes and, instead of participating in all sports, the competitors began to specialize; that is, they concentrated on only one Olympic event. Because of this interest in money and the growing specialization of athletes, the ancient games lost their original idea; they ended in 393 A.D. 
The first of the modern Olympic games took place in the same country as the first known Olympic festivals: Greece. Two hundred and eighty-five athletes from thirteen countries competed in Athens in 1896.
