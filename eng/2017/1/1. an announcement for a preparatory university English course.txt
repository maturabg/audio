Our pre-sessional University English course helps you to improve your English for successful study at an English-speaking university. Teaching is organised on a modular basis. The modules cover the essential academic English skills of writing, reading, listening and speaking; language and vocabulary development; and study and research skills. 
Teaching takes place in small groups with no more than 18 students in a class. You will also have access to additional learning materials on Brookes Virtual – our online learning environment – to build on teaching in class. 
You will be taught by highly qualified academic staff with many years of teaching experience in the UK and overseas. You will be provided with an academic adviser to guide you through the progression to your next course. 
You will have 18 class hours per week. Classes are held Monday to Friday, between 9am and 5pm. The length of classes will be 2 hours each with a 1 hour lunch break. 
You will need to spend at least 20 hours per week on independent study which includes homework, reading and preparation for classes (in groups or individually). 
The course length is 12 weeks, with start dates in June and September 2017, and January 2018. For the exact dates and tuition fees, please visit our website.  
The normal minimum age for this course is 18. We will admit 17-year-olds on a case-by-case basis if they turn 18 during the academic year in which the course runs.
