A little old lady walked into the main branch of Chase Manhattan Bank and wished to open an account. But first, she wanted to meet the President of the bank due to the large amount of money involved. The clerk looked into her bag and saw bundles of $100-dollar bills which could have amounted to millions of dollars. So she called the President and soon the lady was escorted to his office. After the introductions, the President asked how she had come into so much money. 
“I bet,” she said. 
“You bet!” repeated the President. “Do you bet on horses?” “No,” she replied, “I bet on people.” Then all of a sudden, she said: 
“I'll bet you $25,000 that by 10 a.m. tomorrow your nose will have fallen off.” The Bank President didn't see how he could lose, so he accepted. For the rest of the day he was very careful. When he got up in the morning, he looked into the mirror, first thing. There was nothing wrong with his nose. He went to work and waited for the little old lady. 
At 10 sharp, she was escorted into his office, accompanied by a man. She explained that he was her lawyer. 
“Well,” she asked, “what about our bet?” 
“As you can see,” the President replied, “I'm the same as I have always been, only $25,000 richer!” The lady seemed to accept this, but requested to check if his nose was not fake. The President thought that was reasonable, so she caught him by the nose, led him to the window, pulled and pinched – the nose was obviously real and she paid him. Meanwhile, her lawyer had started banging his head against the wall. “What's wrong with him?” the President asked. 
“Oh, him,” she replied, “I bet him $500,000 that by 10 this morning I would be leading the President of Chase Manhattan Bank by the nose.”
