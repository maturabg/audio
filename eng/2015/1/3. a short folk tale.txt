Many years ago, in a small Indian village, a farmer and his daughter worked hard for their living. After a couple of dry years, the farmer ended up owing a large sum of money to the local moneylender. That moneylender, who was old and ugly, fancied the farmer's daughter and he proposed a deal: he would forget about the farmer's debt if he could marry her. 
The farmer refused, so the moneylender suggested that they play a little game. He would place a black stone and a white stone in an empty moneybag. Then the girl would have to pick one stone from the bag. If she picked the black stone, she would become his wife and her father's debt would be forgiven. If she picked the white one, she wouldn't need to marry him and her father's debt would still be forgiven. If she refused to pick a stone, her father would be thrown into prison. 
The three of them, the farmer, his daughter and the moneylender, were standing on a path covered with small round stones in the farmer's field and as they talked, the moneylender bent over to pick two stones. The sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked two black stones and put them into the bag. But she was very clever. When she took out a stone out of the moneybag, she staggered and immediately let it fall onto the stone-covered path without showing it to anyone. “Oh, how clumsy of me!” she exclaimed. “But never mind, if we look into the bag, we will be able to tell which stone I picked.” 
The moneylender did not dare to admit his dishonesty, so he had to forgive the farmer's debt without marrying his daughter.
