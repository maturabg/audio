Hi, everybody! I'm from the town of Salem, Oregon, and I live near Bush's Pasture Park. 
I've just had a most curious adventure in the park and I'd like to know if anyone else from around here or a similar place has had such an experience. My Mom even wouldn't believe me at first – she thought I had lost my hat as I often lose stuff like scarves, gloves, keys and the like. 
Anyway, it was really weird. It was Sunday and as I was running along in the park, I felt it out of nowhere – a scratch on the back of my neck and my hat was pulled right off my head. I turned around because I wanted to know what had just hit me on the head – what was coming for me. Nothing was there. It was completely gone! 
Then I met Jodie, she's a regular on that jogging path and we are friends, kind of. She said it was an aggressive bird, some kind of owl, and I was not the first victim. And none of the hats had turned up. She also said that there were warning signs, which were put up around the park a couple of days ago but I haven't seen them and I'm not the only one <break time="10ms"/> I guess. Jodie said they warned joggers to be careful during the nesting season – from January till March, that is. What does the nesting season have to do with people's hats, I wonder. Mom thinks the bird might need soft things to line its nest with... 
Can anyone tell me more about owls? Are they supposed to be aggressive to people and could they attack and really hurt somebody – a child, for instance?
Dad suggested that I wear my motorbike helmet next time I go jogging in the park...
