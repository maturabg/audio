The London Eye.<break time="1000ms"/>
The London Eye, a giant observation wheel situated on the banks of the River Thames in London, was built as part of London's millennium celebrations.  
Construction of this huge Ferris wheel took more than a year and a half to complete. In the process over 1,700 tonnes of steel were used for the structure and more than 3,000 tonnes of concrete were laid in the foundations. The major components came from six European countries and were transported <prosody rate="slow">piece by piece</prosody> up the River Thames to the construction site on the South Bank. Then it was assembled horizontally on a special support platform over the river and slowly raised with hydraulic lifts and cables, until it reached its 65-degree angle.
Now the Eye stands 135 metres high between Waterloo and Westminster Bridges, right opposite Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, and provides stunning views over central London and beyond.  On a clear day you can see as far as forty kilometres and can observe many famous landmarks, including Buckingham Palace, St. Paul's Cathedral and the Houses of Parliament. It turns slow enough for people to hop on and off as the wheel moves. A complete turn takes about thirty minutes. Thanks to the construction of the egg-shaped glass capsules, the passengers have a great 360 degree bird's-eye view over London.   
If you don't want to miss on this great opportunity, make sure you get your tickets in advance because they are not always available on the day and even if they are, there can be long queues. Or you can visit the Eye at night-time when it is less crowded and the views are even more spectacular.
