The History of Coca-Cola.<break time="1000ms"/>
Coca-Cola, the most-admired and best-known trademark in the world, was invented in 1886 by a pharmacist from Atlanta named Doctor John Pemberton. After making up many drugs, none of which ever made any money, he decided to create something that would bring him commercial success. In his time, the soda-fountain bar was rising in popularity as a social gathering spot. People avoided alcoholic drinks, so making a soda-fountain drink just made sense and he decided to try his hand in the beverage market.  
And this was when Coca-Cola was born. John Pemberton created the flavored syrup mixed with carbonated water, and his partner and bookkeeper Frank Robinson gave its name and first scripted "Coca-Cola" into the flowing letters which have become its famous logo of today. 
However, Coke did not do so well in its first year. The first servings of Coca-Cola were sold for 5 cents per glass and sales averaged a modest nine servings per day in Atlanta.  
After Pemberton's death, a man named Asa Griggs Candler rescued the business. In 1891, he became the only owner of Coca-Cola. It was when Candler took over the company that one of the most innovative marketing techniques was invented. He hired traveling salesmen to pass out coupons for a free Coke. His goal was for people to try the drink, like it, and buy it later on. In addition to the coupons, Candler also decided to spread the word of Coca-Cola by placing its logo on calendars, posters, notebooks and bookmarks to reach customers on a large scale. It was one step in making Coca-Cola a national brand, rather than just a regional brand. 
Several years later, impressed by the growing demand for Coca-Cola and the desire to make the drink portable, other businessmen began bottling Coca-Cola on a large scale. Today CocaCola has become an international drink and it is estimated that if all the Coca-Cola ever produced were to cascade down Niagara Falls at its normal rate of 1.6 million gallons per second, it would flow for nearly 83 hours.
