THE BLT.<break time="1000ms"/>
The BLT are the only bear, lion and tiger in the world that live in the same enclosure. In 2001, Baloo – an American Black Bear, Leo – an African Lion, and Shere Khan – a Bengal Tiger, were discovered in an Atlanta home's basement by police officers while they were searching for drugs. Only a few months old, all three cubs were frightened, underfed, and infected with internal and external parasites. 
The Georgia Department of Natural Resources brought the cubs to Noah's Ark, a non-profit animal shelter in Georgia that is home to over 1,500 animals from 100 different species. They are devoted to rescuing and providing a permanent home for animals that have been mistreated, abandoned or neglected, as well as animals who are put in their care for many different reasons. 
When the three cubs arrived to Noah's Ark, each had their own health problems. Shere Khan, the tiger, was skin and bones, and Leo, the lion, had an open, infected wound on his nose from cruel confinement to a small cage. 
Baloo, the American Black Bear, was in the worst condition of the three cubs rescued, with his collar digging into the flesh of his neck because it was never loosened as he grew in size. The flesh had begun to grow over and around it, and surgical intervention was required to remove it and clean his deep, infected wounds. Baloo's surgery was the only time when the three brothers have ever been separated from one another. 
The trio, affectionately known as "the BLT", eat, sleep and play together. They even take care of one another and are often seen rubbing their heads together or licking one another. Their terrifying early months in life have bonded the three like real brothers and they are truly inseparable.
