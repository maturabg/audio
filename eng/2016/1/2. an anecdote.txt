<speak>A MIME AT THE ZOO.<break time="1000ms"/>
One day a jobless mime visits the zoo to earn some money as a street performer. As soon as he starts to draw a crowd, a zoo keeper grabs him and drags him into his office. The zoo keeper explains to the mime performer that the zoo's most popular attraction, a gorilla, has died suddenly and offers the mime a job to dress up as the gorilla until they can get another one. The mime accepts. 
So the next morning the mime puts on the gorilla suit and enters the cage before the crowd comes. He discovers that it's a great job and he draws bigger crowds than he ever did as a mime. However, eventually people begin paying more attention to the lion in the cage next to his. Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience, he climbs to the top of his cage, crawls across a partition, and hangs, swinging from the top to the lion's cage. Of course, this makes the lion furious, but the crowd loves it. 
At the end of the day the zoo keeper comes and gives the mime a raise for being such a good attraction. This goes on for some time and his salary keeps going up. Then one terrible day when he is swinging over the furious lion he slips and falls. 
The lion gathers itself and prepares to attack. The mime begins to run round and round the cage screaming and yelling, 'Help! Help me!', but the lion is quick and jumps on him. The mime soon finds himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion who says, 'Shut up, you idiot! Do you want to get us both fired?'
